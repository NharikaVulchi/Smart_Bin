**Problem Statement**


* Waste disposal is a major problem in today's world. The  method of removing the large amount of waste generated had a harmful effect on the environment. Unplanned landfilling by municipalities is a common waste disposal method. This method affects the health of people, plants and animals.
* When waste is separated into basic streams such as wet, dry and metal, the waste has greater potential for recovery and as a result is recycled and reused.
* The wet waste fraction  often becomes either  compost or methane gas, or both. Compost can replace the demand for chemical fertilizers and biogas can be used as an energy source.
* Scrap metal can be recycled or recycled.
* Although there are large-scale industrial waste sorting facilities, it is always much better to sort the waste itself at the source.
* The advantage is that  higher quality  material is left for recycling, which means more value is obtained from the waste. The occupational hazard of waste workers is reduced.
* Sorted waste could also be sent directly  to a recycling and processing plant instead of going to a sorting facility rather than a recycling plant.

**Proposed Solution**

* A smart waste segregator is implemented which sorts the waste into metal, dry and wet based on sensor values.
* Inductive proximity sensors are employed to identify metallic items, and moisture sensors to distinguish between wet and dry waste depending upon the threshold values set.
* Upon the corresponding sensor values, DC motors are operated to open the lids of concerned bins to segregate the waste
* Also, when the bin is full, none of the lids are opened and a LED is turned ON to indicate that garbage is full.
